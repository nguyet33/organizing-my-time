# organizing-my-time


## My Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Installations
Begin at the GitHub repository that holds the code:
https://github.com/nguyet33/organizing-my-time

Once you are at the correct repo, click on the green "<> Code" button and select "SSH" under the "Local" tab.

Copy the SSH key to your clipboard and navigate to your terminal.

Once you are in your terminal, navigate to the directory of which you would like to clone this repository.

When you are at the destination you would like to clone, follow through with the git cloning procedures as you would normally.

For Windows: git clone "key that was copied to your clipboard" --> Enter

## Acceptance Criteria

THIS PART IS MAINLY FOR ME TO TRACK

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
